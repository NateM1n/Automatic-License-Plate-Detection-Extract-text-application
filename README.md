The goal is to develop a YOLO trained model that has the ability to scan and store scanned license plates in a database. The model is trained with 20 different state-type license plate models. Within the 20 trained plates that it can detect/scan, it will automatically enter the plate numbers and state classification into the database, allowing easy access to the car's plate information for future use if needed. Planning & Design, Development, Deployment & Testing, and Additional Features. The result is a project that exercises a wide range from JavaScript, PHP, MYSQL, AJAX, JSON, and more to complete and finish this product.
